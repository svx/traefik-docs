# User Feedback Proposal

The goal is to create the best possible documentation for users.

To do so, as a first step, we want to get feedback from the Traefik community.

---

## What is this about?

The idea is to get feedback from daily (regularly) user of the [Traefik Proxy documentation.](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)

See here a (not finalized) list of (possible) questions:

- What are the pain points?
- What is confusing?
- How does the user feel about the docs in general, are they too technical?
- Should we adjust the docs to fit more “new” and “advanced” humans?
- Does the content structure make sense?
- Does the user find what they is looking for?
- How is the general UX?
- Should the docs have more interactive content?
- Should the docs have more diagrams and picture to explain functionality?
- Should the docs (or Traefik) should have an “official” repo with examples?
- What does the user like to see improved first?
- What kind of content we’re missing in the docs?
- What do you like about the current docs?

## What is this not about

Everything else!

This proposal is **only** about getting feedback related to the content of the documentation.

This proposal is **not** about any changes to the built-chain, tooling, theme, or something else.

It is only about gathering feedback to get a better overview.

## How to collect the feedback?

There will be two different ways:

1. An online survey
2. Short, 30-min max video calls via Google

### Why two ways?

The intention behind this is to be as welcoming as possible and to cover difference audiences.

Some individuals prefer to fill out a survey, others prefer to have a more personal experience.

## The data

After all interviews are conducted and the online survey is ended, we’ll summarize the results as a summary on the [Traefik Community Forum](https://community.traefik.io/) and publish them also on [GitHub](https://github.com/svx/traefik-docs).
